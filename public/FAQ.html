            group you should avoid (this is also useful for entering other
            groups). Check the numbered questions below.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ Item 1 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Question 1: I want to learn coding - where do I start?</h3>
          <p>
            You can start by googling and reading as much as possible about
            coding. Coding is not one thing, it is many things, like building.
          </p>
          <p>
            With building there is brick laying, framing, tiling, electrical,
            plumbing,......
          </p>
          <p>
            With coding there is web development, windows app development,
            mobile phone app development, micrcontroller programming & digital
            electronics, unix app development,.......
          </p>
          <p>
            Where you start with coding depends on which of the above most
            interests you.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ Item 2 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Question 2: Which language should I learn first or next?</h3>
          <p>Which language is easiest to learn?</p>
          <p>Which is easiest to learn html, python, or java?</p>
          <p>What is the hardest thing to learn in coding?</p>
          <hr />
          <p>a) No one language is easier to learn coding with than another.</p>
          <p>
            b) Learning the syntax of a language is a VERY MINOR part of
            learning to code.
          </p>
          <p>
            c) Learning to think logically, to break large problems down into
            small bits that are then easy to code, learning to use functions and
            parameters properly and learning to write efficient code that is
            easy to understand - they are hard to learn and take time and LOTS
            of practice. You WILL NOT learn this any faster with Python than you
            will with C and C++
          </p>
          <p>
            So what language should you learn first? Which ever one that you
            personally find the most aesthetically pleasing, the one that you
            have the most interest in learning and the one you are most likely
            to stick at when the learning gets TOUGH! HTML can't be learned in
            isolation from CSS, Javascript and PHP. All are required to create
            interactive and responsive web pages. PHP and Javascript have the
            same issues as detailed above.
          </p>

        <!-- FAQ Item 3 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Question 3: Can I code on my mobile phone?</h3>
          <p>
            You can bit you will be VERY limited as to this sort of coding you
            can do.
          </p>
          <p>
            You really need a laptop of desktop computer, with its greater
            flexibility, to learn coding well.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ Item 4 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Question 4: What is the best laptop or desktop to use?</h3>
          <p>
            Any computer that is capable of running Windows 10 or Linux Mint is
            just fine!
          </p>

            is also a viable choice for coding and more affordable than a
            regular desktop or laptop.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ Item 5 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Question 5: What software do I need to code?</h3>
          <p>That depends on what language you want to learn.</p>
          <p>Python: Thonny or PyCharm community edition</p>
          <p>
            C/C++/C+: MS Visual Studio Community - you will need to do some
            tutorial on how to use this software as it is industry standard
            software and is rather complex. Or MS VS Code with the correct
            plugins.
          </p>

          <p>Arduino IDE for Arduino microcontrollers</p>
          <p>Thonny for Raspberry Pi Pico MCU</p>
          <p>
            DevC is a great C/C++ IDE for Windows also recommended is Microsoft
            visual studio community edition
          </p>
          <p>Cxxdroid a great C/C++ compiler for android</p>

        <!-- FAQ Item 6 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>
            Question 6: If you want our help with bugs then please do not post
            photographs of the code on your laptop from your mobile phone.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Often we can't read the code in your photographs due to reflected
            light washing out the image. We need to see your FULL code AND we
            need to be able to past it into an IDE and debug it ourselves
            sometimes.
          </p>

          <p>Put your mobile phone down!.</p>
          <p>
            Open the web browser on your computer and bring up the Facebook
            group there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, at he very least, you can copy your entire code as text and
            paste it into your post rather than a photo of your code. If you
            have more than one source file, e.g. something.htm and styles.css,
            then compress them all into a zip file.
          </p>
          <p>If you don't know how to do this then start GOOGLING.</p>
          <p>
            Then attach the zip file, containing your source file, to your post.
            You can do this by simply dragging and dropping the zip file onto
            the post edit window.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Question 7: Can someone teach me coding for free?</h3>
          <p>Short answer: no they won't.</p>
          <p>
            Just as I don't think it is acceptable for recruiters to expect
            beginners in here to code for them for free, nor do I think it is
            reasonable for beginners to expect us to spend hours teaching them
            for free. If you mow my lawns and mop my floors for free then I will
            teach you to code for free! We have bills and rent to pay too!
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are not prepared or can't afford to pay one of us as your
            private mentor then you need to take responsibility for your own
            learning with the ABUNDANT free resources out there on the web. But
            by all means ask questions about particular problems you are having.
            But NO! We won't be giving you private tuition for free.

            It is not possible to do any SERIOUS coding on a mobile device - it
            is the wrong tool for the job.

          <p>
            You need a laptop or a desktop computer. If you can't afford one of

            approximately $200 AU by the time you get a keyboard, mouse and
            screen to go with it.

          <h3>Question 9: I need a coding mentor.</h3>
          <p>
            There is a tab at the top of this group where mentors have listed
            their paid services. You need to look there and PM the one you like
            the most.

            Question 11: What is the best programming language to learn so I can
            get a job?
          </h3>
          <p>
            There is no one programming language that will guarantee you of a
            job. Different companies create different types of software, and
            different types of software require different programming languages.
          </p>

          <p>
            And quite often, products use multiple types of software to operate
            them. Consider GridConnect smart home products. They use Android and
            iOS apps running on a mobile device to turn them on and off and
            change their settings.
          </p>

          <p>
            But the devices themselves require special firmware running on them
            in order to make them react to signals from the mobile device and
            the state of internal electronics components.
          </p>

          <p>
            So if you want the best chance of getting a job in the IT sector,
            then the more languages that you can competently program in, the
            better.

          <p>
            If you want to get a job in larger corporations then more than
            likely such employers will require a Bachelors degree from a
            reputable university.
          </p>
          <p>
            Smaller niche companies on the cutting edge of tech may well accept

            capabilities well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Few reputable employers in the west are likely to accept
            certificates issued by two bit boot camp companies located in India
            and Pakistan etc. These boot camp courses do nothing more than teach
            the syntax of a language. But simply knowing the syntax of a
            language does not make you a job ready programmer. And any reputable
            employers of programmers know this!
