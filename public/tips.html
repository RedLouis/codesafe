            Tips on how to set up and maintain a professional Facebook profile:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use a clear profile picture. Don't show up half naked, future
              employers or team members might see your picture and dislike it
            </li>
            <li>Provide accurate information in your profile.</li>
            <li>
              Keep your contact information updated and don't share private
              information like account names or phone numbers which could lead
              to trouble.
            </li>
            <li>
              Include photos of yourself that are relevant for the people you
              want to connect with online, prevent nudity and sensitive content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't forget this is the internet, everything you post will be
              used against you, just like in court.
            </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Share relevant and helpful content, your dog or cat may be cute,
              but that is not content for a coding group.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't try to sell stuff, there are other places like Facebook
              Market for that
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't excessively promote your own work, it is nice if you have a
              blog, but don't put links in every post you see.
            </li>
            <li>Avoid using clickbait titles or links.</li>
            <li>Show that you put some effort in your question or post.</li>
            <li>
              Ask questions
